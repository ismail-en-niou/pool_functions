# Examination Tasks of the 42 Test Pool

The exam consists of 75 tasks, divided into 6 levels of progressive difficulty, numbered from 0 to 5. Level 0 tasks are as simple as `only_a`, where the character 'a' is outputted to the standard output. Tasks at levels 4 and 5 are as challenging as `flood_fill`, `ft_itoa_base`, and `print_memory`. By correctly completing each task, you move up one level, thereby increasing the difficulty of the task.

Covered topics include string manipulation, bitwise operations, memory allocation, sorting algorithms, basic data structures, linked lists, and basic transformations. Some of these tasks may be exercises from projects, while others may be entirely new.

Solutions must execute within 10 seconds; no further optimization is required.

# About Taking Exams at School 42

Exams are held every Tuesday morning from `9:00` to `13:00` at the School 42 building. Students enter a special exam account with limited access to applications and the internet, and they take the test using a text editor (`Sublime Text`, `vim`, `emacs`), `git`, and their own terminal application called `examshell`.

Students are asked one question at a time, starting the test from level 0. For each correct solution, they earn points and move on to the next test level, up to level 5 maximum. For each incorrect solution, students are given another task at the same level, but the number of points they can earn at the current level decreases by 5. Up to 16 points can be earned at each of levels 0 through 4, and up to 20 points can be earned at level 5. The maximum score achievable for the exam is 100 points.

To pass the exam, students must score at least 75 points. To pass the exam project and qualify for the next level of difficulty, the average of the student's best 5 attempts must be at least 75 points for beginners or 84 for intermediates.

# How and Where to Write Code in the 42 School Exam Room

You can use `Sublime Text`, `vim`, or `emacs` during 42 exams! However, there is one important restriction: you must not use dialog windows such as `Open File`, `Save As`, or for unnamed files, `Save`. Doing so will crash your computer. Instead, open and save files using the following methods:

- To create files, type in the terminal:
